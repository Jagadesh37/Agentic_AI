# Agentic_AI
Agentic AI with LangGraph — Project Overview

This repository contains an interactive Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to build agentic AI workflows using LangGraph — a framework designed for creating stateful, multi-step, and controllable AI agents.

The notebook walks through:

🚀 What This Notebook Covers

Introduction to LangGraph

Core concepts: nodes, edges, state, interrupts

How LangGraph differs from LangChain
Building Agent Workflows
Creating an agent with memory and state
Adding tools and defining agent behavior
Creating loops, branching logic, and conditional flows
Graph-Based Reasoning
How to visualize agent execution
How nodes pass data between each other
Using LangGraph to model complex decision structures
Agent Execution Examples
Running the agent step-by-step
Handling tool calls
Using checkpoints and resumable workflows

🏗️ Technologies Used
LangGraph
LangChain
Python 3

This project serves as a clear, beginner-friendly example of how to build stateful, controlled, and tool-using AI agents with LangGraph.
It is ideal for anyone learning:
Agent architecture
Multi-step reasoning
AI workflows with persistence
Practical use of LangGraph in real projects

The notebook includes:
Code walk-throughs
Agent state diagrams
Execution traces
Practical working examples

🧩 Future Enhancements

Add multiple agents interacting
Extend with real-world tools (search, API calls, DB)
Convert to a Python package
Add LangGraph visualization components
